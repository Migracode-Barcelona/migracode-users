# Workshop Full-Stack Login System (Node + SQL + JWT)

## Before to start

1. Think about a complete login system, draw the forms on a paper
2. Could you list the different endpoints your backend needs to be able to complete all login functionalities? explain how would work each one and dessign the database on a paper
3. Here is a small introduction video to JWT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soGRyl9ztjI, watch it and try to exlpain meaning of these words: HTTP, session, stateless, authentications, authorization, token, cookie, load balancer
4. If more or less you understand how JWT works, watch this video that explains in more detail the steps to apply it to a login system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXxbB5kv9OA
5. List again the different endpoints and the database your backend needs using JWT
